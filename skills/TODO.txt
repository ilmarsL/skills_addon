Fix error:
Steps to reproduce "TypeError: can't access dead object" (on temporary addon)
1. Save some names from tab using 'Add skill' button
2. Close tab.

Opening and closing popup also seems to trigger the error.
Clicking on developer tools also trigers exception
Loosing focus of window and then clicking 'S' button;.

Could be because of how selected text get's captured.
