Move skill saving to 'save button'?
---------------------
Manually editable 'url to save' field
--------------------------------
Uninstalling addon does not clear saved dat from storage;
(not sure if this is a problem;)
---------------------------
Add checker for if page has been visited. (linkedin specific, should search for url starting with https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2474687159)
-------------
- add delete button
------------------------
- Make addon button change color, if this url is in storage;
-------------------
Manualy add skill;

-------------------
Fix error:
Steps to reproduce "TypeError: can't access dead object" (on temporary addon)
1. Save some names from tab using 'Add skill' button
2. Close tab.

Opening and closing popup also seems to trigger the error.
Clicking on developer tools also trigers exception
Loosing focus of window and then clicking 'S' button;.

Could be because of how selected text get's captured.

-------------------------
Firefox bug?
When inspecting local storage, it doesn't refresh until you press 'inspect' again (refresh button doesnt work)  
--------------------------

- Test if .toLowerCase() works in stats;

- In stats page, make url a href and make it shorter (LinkedIn URLs are too long).

- highlight skills after selected

- Highlight skills autmatically;

- Test in chrome


---------------------------------
- This can work as bookmark
